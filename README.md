Forest Carbon Mapping Project: Technical Due Diligence Report
Methodological Foundation
This forest carbon mapping project employs a robust machine learning approach to estimate biomass and carbon sequestration in forest ecosystems, with a specific focus on German forests. The methodology combines:
1.	Remote sensing data integration: We utilize Landsat 8 surface reflectance imagery (bands 2-7) from the summer months (June-September 2019) to capture spectral signatures of forest vegetation during peak growing season, filtered for cloud coverage below 30%.
2.	Vegetation indices: The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) serves as our primary biophysical indicator of photosynthetic activity and vegetation health.
3.	Auxiliary environmental variables: Our model incorporates percentage tree cover from the Hansen Global Forest Change dataset (2023 version, using the 2000 base year) and topographic information (SRTM elevation data) to account for environmental heterogeneity.
4.	Reference carbon data: The NASA/ORNL aboveground biomass carbon density dataset provides ground-truth values for model training and validation.
5.	Machine learning algorithm: We employ a Random Forest regression model (50 trees, minimum leaf population of 5) to capture complex non-linear relationships between environmental variables and carbon stocks.
Validation Approach and Results
Our validation strategy consists of:
1.	Data partitioning: 70% of data points are used for model training, with the remaining 30% reserved for independent validation.
2.	Performance metrics: Model accuracy assessment yielded:
o	Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): 22.42 tonnes/ha
o	Coefficient of determination (RÂ²): 0.618
3.	Spatial validation: The model's spatial predictions are visualized and compared against reference data to identify potential regional biases.
4.	Cross-checking with literature: Our results are compared with published field measurements and other modeling approaches to ensure ecological plausibility.
Temporal Differences in Data Sources
The project utilizes datasets from different time periods due to availability and quality considerations:
1.	Landsat 8 imagery (2019): Selected for optimal growing season coverage with minimal cloud interference. The 2019 summer period provided exceptionally clear imagery for German forests.
2.	Hansen Global Forest Change (based on 2000 data, updated through 2023): This dataset provides the baseline forest extent. While from an earlier period, it offers the most comprehensive tree cover data available at high resolution.
3.	SRTM elevation data: Collected in 2000, this topographic information remains valid as terrain characteristics change minimally over time.
4.	NASA/ORNL biomass carbon density: This dataset represents the most current globally consistent carbon density estimates available for model training.
These temporal differences represent a common challenge in environmental modeling, where perfect temporal alignment of datasets is rarely achievable. However, the relatively slow rate of change in forest structural characteristics (outside of disturbance events) makes this approach valid for carbon estimation.
Forest Carbon Summary for Germany
The analysis produced the following key statistics:
1.	Mean Forest Carbon Density: 62.99 tonnes/ha
2.	Total Forest Carbon: 14,678,299 tonnes
These figures align with published estimates for German forests, considering that our analysis focused on areas with tree cover greater than 25%.





Potential Applications in AI-Supported Carbon Accounting
This framework offers several promising applications:
1.	Carbon offset verification: Independent verification of forest carbon projects by comparing claimed sequestration against modeled potential.
2.	Dynamic monitoring: Tracking forest carbon stock changes over time to assess the effectiveness of conservation initiatives or the impact of disturbances.
3.	Regional planning: Supporting policy decisions by identifying high-carbon forest areas for prioritized protection.
4.	Climate adaptation strategies: Identifying forest areas most vulnerable to carbon loss under changing climate conditions.
5.	Decision support for sustainable forestry: Optimizing forest management practices to enhance carbon sequestration while maintaining other ecosystem services.
